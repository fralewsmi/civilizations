Just a bit of fun really.

I was doing a bit of research in historical civillisations, paticulary with interest outside of the typical eurocentric model of human development.
I asked Claude for a summary and ended up getting a pretty nice html canvas visualisation out of it.
This is just static data with plain html, css.
